Working with an agency, Sony is no stranger to dreaming up large projects and churning them out quickly.</p>\n<p>Most would say that four months to build a website with highly customized design and related content (tying together the artisans to their artwork to their stories to the cameras and accessories they use) is no easy feat.&nbsp;And, in most legacy systems, that would be true. Sony needed a highly secure platform to not only build a website, but build their community.&nbsp;Sony&rsquo;s team uses Zesty.io\'s Two-Factor authentication to stop social engineering attacks and attacks via compromised email accounts.&nbsp; Placing their community in the hands of a highly secure enterprise SaaS platform with 99.99% availability and no patches, plugins, or updates to make meant that the team could focus on what they do best: build.</p>\n<h2>2.25X Faster to Market</h2>\n<p>"We originally allocated 4 months to deploy Sony&rsquo;s &lsquo;Alpha Universe&rsquo; website, designed to drive engagement with both existing and prospective customers of our Alpha camera lineup," says Matthew Parnell, MARCOM Manager of Sony Electronics. "By using Zesty.io as our CMS, we were able to soft launch in 6 weeks and fully launch within 2 months.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So they\'d found a solution that would get them off the ground quickly. Harnessing the power of influencer marketing and highlighting individuals within their community, the growth was exponential.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>164% QoQ Growth Average</h2>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%;" title="Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-3.59.11-PM.png" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-3.59.11-PM.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;With an extremely efficient UI and a host of innovative features, Zesty.io has become the backbone of our customer engagement success, as the site has received over half a million customer visits in its first few months.&rdquo; And it\'s only grown since. In fact, Sony\'s Alpha Universe has expanded globally, harnessing a community of tens of thousands of professional photographers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Zesty.io platform has quickly developed into a global benchmark for Sony&rsquo;s content marketing. We are now working with Zesty.io to deploy this strategy in other key regions throughout the world."&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="be-inspired.jpg" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/be-inspired.jpg" alt="" width="742" height="499" /></p>',

Working with an agency, Sony is no stranger to dreaming up large projects and churning them out quickly.</p>\n<p>Most would say that four months to build a website with highly customized design and related content (tying together the artisans to their artwork to their stories to the cameras and accessories they use) is no easy feat.&nbsp;And, in most legacy systems, that would be true. Sony needed a highly secure platform to not only build a website, but build their community.&nbsp;Sony&rsquo;s team uses Zesty.io\'s Two-Factor authentication to stop social engineering attacks and attacks via compromised email accounts.&nbsp; Placing their community in the hands of a highly secure enterprise SaaS platform with 99.99% availability and no patches, plugins, or updates to make meant that the team could focus on what they do best: build.</p>\n<h2>2.25X Faster to Market</h2>\n<p>"We originally allocated 4 months to deploy Sony&rsquo;s &lsquo;Alpha Universe&rsquo; website, designed to drive engagement with both existing and prospective customers of our Alpha camera lineup," says Matthew Parnell, MARCOM Manager of Sony Electronics. "By using Zesty.io as our CMS, we were able to soft launch in 6 weeks and fully launch within 2 months.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So they\'d found a solution that would get them off the ground quickly. Harnessing the power of influencer marketing and highlighting individuals within their community, the growth was exponential.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>164% QoQ Growth Average</h2>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%;" title="Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-3.59.11-PM.png" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-3.59.11-PM.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;With an extremely efficient UI and a host of innovative features, Zesty.io has become the backbone of our customer engagement success, as the site has received over half a million customer visits in its first few months.&rdquo; And it\'s only grown since. In fact, Sony\'s Alpha Universe has expanded globally, harnessing a community of tens of thousands of professional photographers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Zesty.io platform has quickly developed into a global benchmark for Sony&rsquo;s content marketing. We are now working with Zesty.io to deploy this strategy in other key regions throughout the world."&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="be-inspired.jpg" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/be-inspired.jpg" alt="" width="742" height="499" /></p></div>\n</div>\n',

One that stood out was <a href="https://www.zesty.io/mindshare/customer-stories/sony-uses-zesty-io-to-accelerate-launch-of-alpha-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony\'s Alpha Universe</a>. This is a beautifully designed website created to showcase photographers and their incredible artwork captured with the Sony Alpha Camera line. Psyonix thought they could also showcase their highly active, tight-knit community of Rocket League Esports teams and players.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Leveraging Influencer Marketing to Support Millions of Players and Fans</h2>\n<p>With over 25 million unique players and 1.1 million players a day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on average</a>, the team at Rocket League is fostering and growing a huge community. So they\'d found a solution that would get them off the ground quickly. Harnessing the power of influencer marketing and highlighting individuals within their community, the growth was exponential.</p>\n<p>So, the team set out to create a new space for their players to consume content surrounding the professional side of Rocket League. Managing the feel of the brand on the new website is important, too.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>"Community polls, audio players, and other cool widgets and CMS plugins can be customized with Zesty.io whereas there was not as much flexibility to brand certain elements like that using previous systems. Many of those would have to be outside plugins that didn&rsquo;t really gel with our brand style."</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>- <strong>Kyle Lemmon</strong>, Marketing Manager at Psyonix</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Growing the Professional Side</h2>\n<p><img style="padding: 15px max-width: 100%;" title="kyle-lemmon.jpeg" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/kyle-lemmon.jpeg" alt="" width="157" height="157" align="left" /></p>\n<p>"Our community loves new content and hearing about new updates for the game, and in turn we enjoy finding new ways to improve on the concept of Rocket League while keeping the core gameplay concept intact. Depending on the in-game content, we&rsquo;re able to create and deliver additional promotional content to the community on the site and beyond," says Lemmon. As the community grows, the marketing team continues to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow and support tournaments</a> with payouts of hundreds of thousands of dollars and televised on networks such as Twitch and Turner Broadcasting. The Esports website is the hub for the professional energy surrounding Rocket League.</p>\n<h2>Managing Relational Content in Zesty.io</h2>\n<p>The content throughout the Esports website is highly relational: players are related to teams, and teams to tournaments, tournaments to outcomes, and everything in between. With Zesty.io\'s highly intuitive platform, community managers are able to update content easily on the fly and see those changes updated wherever content appears on the site, ensuring the most up-to-date data in a world where statistics are changing by the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>"We publish blogs on the site almost every week day and landing pages at least one per quarter. That is easier since switching to Zesty.io since even content creators on our team (that can&rsquo;t code) can implement changes on the site and publish new content without assistance of an outside team," says Lemmon.</p>\n<p>Talk about a score.</p>\n<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 55%; position: relative;"><iframe width="100%" height="100%" style="position: absolute; max-width: 100%;" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT0xepBLaRaduNgkne" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="button is-primary is-outlined" href="https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/">View Rocket League\'s Esports Website &gt;</a></p>',

One that stood out was <a href="https://www.zesty.io/mindshare/customer-stories/sony-uses-zesty-io-to-accelerate-launch-of-alpha-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony\'s Alpha Universe</a>. This is a beautifully designed website created to showcase photographers and their incredible artwork captured with the Sony Alpha Camera line. Psyonix thought they could also showcase their highly active, tight-knit community of Rocket League Esports teams and players.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Leveraging Influencer Marketing to Support Millions of Players and Fans</h2>\n<p>With over 25 million unique players and 1.1 million players a day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on average</a>, the team at Rocket League is fostering and growing a huge community. So they\'d found a solution that would get them off the ground quickly. Harnessing the power of influencer marketing and highlighting individuals within their community, the growth was exponential.</p>\n<p>So, the team set out to create a new space for their players to consume content surrounding the professional side of Rocket League. Managing the feel of the brand on the new website is important, too.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>"Community polls, audio players, and other cool widgets and CMS plugins can be customized with Zesty.io whereas there was not as much flexibility to brand certain elements like that using previous systems. Many of those would have to be outside plugins that didn&rsquo;t really gel with our brand style."</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>- <strong>Kyle Lemmon</strong>, Marketing Manager at Psyonix</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Growing the Professional Side</h2>\n<p><img style="padding: 15px max-width: 100%;" title="kyle-lemmon.jpeg" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/kyle-lemmon.jpeg" alt="" width="157" height="157" align="left" /></p>\n<p>"Our community loves new content and hearing about new updates for the game, and in turn we enjoy finding new ways to improve on the concept of Rocket League while keeping the core gameplay concept intact. Depending on the in-game content, we&rsquo;re able to create and deliver additional promotional content to the community on the site and beyond," says Lemmon. As the community grows, the marketing team continues to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow and support tournaments</a> with payouts of hundreds of thousands of dollars and televised on networks such as Twitch and Turner Broadcasting. The Esports website is the hub for the professional energy surrounding Rocket League.</p>\n<h2>Managing Relational Content in Zesty.io</h2>\n<p>The content throughout the Esports website is highly relational: players are related to teams, and teams to tournaments, tournaments to outcomes, and everything in between. With Zesty.io\'s highly intuitive platform, community managers are able to update content easily on the fly and see those changes updated wherever content appears on the site, ensuring the most up-to-date data in a world where statistics are changing by the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>"We publish blogs on the site almost every week day and landing pages at least one per quarter. That is easier since switching to Zesty.io since even content creators on our team (that can&rsquo;t code) can implement changes on the site and publish new content without assistance of an outside team," says Lemmon.</p>\n<p>Talk about a score.</p>\n<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 55%; position: relative;"><iframe width="100%" height="100%" style="position: absolute; max-width: 100%;" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT0xepBLaRaduNgkne" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="button is-primary is-outlined" href="https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/">View Rocket League\'s Esports Website &gt;</a></p></div>\n</div>\n',

               '<p><img style="max-width: 100%;" title="petdesk-devices.png" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/petdesk-devices.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p>Headquartered in Sunny San Diego, PetDesk improves the quality of life for pets by using technology to connect pet care providers and pet parents.&nbsp;Pet care businesses rely on their software to manage online and offline activities, increase client engagement, and access actionable data to improve their bottom line.&nbsp;Pet parents download the PetDesk app to enjoy 24/7 access to their pet care providers, records and reminders in just one place.</p>\n<p>As PetDesk grew and worked with veterinarians and pet groomers, they learned that there was a need they had in common: the website. Most offices were struggling with their website, weren\'t sure how to edit it, didn\'t know how to update the infrastructure or software, and were generally confused. Seeing this opportunity, Zesty.io and PetDesk partnered to provide websites for PetDesk\'s clientele.</p>\n<p>After partnering with Zesty.io, PetDesk was able to grow its revenue and scale immensely and now manage over one hundred sites without additional personnel or resources. The key to PetDesk\'s continuing success is that its team is empowered by the right technology.</p>\n<h2>New Revenue and Added Client Value</h2>\n<h3>Scalable Multi-site Software that Increased Revenue</h3>\n<p>PetDesk provides an app and reminder system to local veterinarians and pet shops. As with many small businesses, a website can hinder success and served as a barrier to their sales.&nbsp;&ldquo;Zesty.io enabled us to drive immediate revenue while providing tangible value to our customers," says PetDesk CEO Taylor Cavanah. "An integrated PetDesk and Zesty.io solution allowed us to offer a complete retention and acquisition solution to our customers that was once cost prohibitive."</p>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%;" title="Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-5.03.48-PM.png" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-5.03.48-PM.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>\n<p>Even better, Zesty.io\'s SaaS solution could be implemented in seconds, not days, weeks, or even months. "Practically overnight we could make our customers happier, while growing revenue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Zesty.io integration is now a key differentiator in our sales pitch," says Cavanah.</p>\n<h2>Scalable Multi-site Management</h2>\n<p>As the model proved successful, there were some hesitations of growing costs to accommodate the growing demand. &ldquo;The platform allowed us to double our website builds and services using our existing staff. After setting up, our existing sales team starting selling the websites as an add-on immediately while our accounts team fulfilled the service. Every account manager became proficient in the platform in a few days time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Tailored to Customers</h2>\n<h3>Template design to match targeted industries</h3>\n<p>Part of why PetDesk\'s implementation was so speedy and continues to be so scalable is the templated nature of PetDesk sites, "When we started, we worked with Zesty.io&rsquo;s team to create unique website designs that matched our customer demographic. This gives our sales team options to present our customers." And, as PetDesk continues to scale, all they need is a front-end developer to continue building new templates or accommodate custom requests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="petdesk-zestyio.jpg" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/petdesk-zestyio.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="244" /></p>',

Most offices were struggling with their website, weren\'t sure how to edit it, didn\'t know how to update the infrastructure or software, and were generally confused. Seeing this opportunity, Zesty.io and PetDesk partnered to provide websites for PetDesk\'s clientele.</p>\n<p>After partnering with Zesty.io, PetDesk was able to grow its revenue and scale immensely and now manage over one hundred sites without additional personnel or resources. The key to PetDesk\'s continuing success is that its team is empowered by the right technology.</p>\n<h2>New Revenue and Added Client Value</h2>\n<h3>Scalable Multi-site Software that Increased Revenue</h3>\n<p>PetDesk provides an app and reminder system to local veterinarians and pet shops. As with many small businesses, a website can hinder success and served as a barrier to their sales.&nbsp;&ldquo;Zesty.io enabled us to drive immediate revenue while providing tangible value to our customers," says PetDesk CEO Taylor Cavanah. "An integrated PetDesk and Zesty.io solution allowed us to offer a complete retention and acquisition solution to our customers that was once cost prohibitive."</p>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%;" title="Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-5.03.48-PM.png" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-5.03.48-PM.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>\n<p>Even better, Zesty.io\'s SaaS solution could be implemented in seconds, not days, weeks, or even months. "Practically overnight we could make our customers happier, while growing revenue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Zesty.io integration is now a key differentiator in our sales pitch," says Cavanah.</p>\n<h2>Scalable Multi-site Management</h2>\n<p>As the model proved successful, there were some hesitations of growing costs to accommodate the growing demand. &ldquo;The platform allowed us to double our website builds and services using our existing staff. After setting up, our existing sales team starting selling the websites as an add-on immediately while our accounts team fulfilled the service. Every account manager became proficient in the platform in a few days time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Tailored to Customers</h2>\n<h3>Template design to match targeted industries</h3>\n<p>Part of why PetDesk\'s implementation was so speedy and continues to be so scalable is the templated nature of PetDesk sites, "When we started, we worked with Zesty.io&rsquo;s team to create unique website designs that matched our customer demographic. This gives our sales team options to present our customers." And, as PetDesk continues to scale, all they need is a front-end developer to continue building new templates or accommodate custom requests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="petdesk-zestyio.jpg" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/petdesk-zestyio.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="244" /></p></div>\n</div>\n',

Designed from the ground up and starting from scratch with a new CMS, the agency was able to deliver a brand new site ahead of schedule.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It took us one month to complete the project, and it was completed as planned and projected," says Brian Nilayan, Head of Business Development at Rebar Solutions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The learning curve was surprisingly easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key positives that we can say for Zesty.io are that the platform is relatively easy to learn, flexible, scalable, and faster to develop on. We were able to meet our deadlines early to allow for extra review and have a seamless launch.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Agency Wins</h2>\n<h3>Zesty.io Empowers Agency with Major Advantages in Client\'s Go To Market</h3>\n<p>In this build, there were significant process improvements for the agency\'s internal workflows. They speak for themselves -&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div><strong>78% faster version control. </strong>Using Zesty.io\'s built in code versioning on every saved code change meant easy reverts to different code versions.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>67% faster development time.</strong> Because backend data handling and different development environment are all handled by Zesty.io, the agency mostly needed to focus on Frontend development.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n<li><strong>69% improvement in page load times. </strong>Server processes are all handled by Zesty.io.</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>42% less agency resources.</strong> With Zesty.io, there is no need for a system admin to handle the project\'s deployment and there are less developers that need to handle the project\'s backend.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>37% reduction in QA Resources. </strong>Due to the site\'s optimized performance and Zesty\'s backend error handlings during development, there was a significant reduction in conflicts when endorsed to the QAs for testing.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>99% faster deployment</strong> - only need to push one button on new or updated page content with real time code changes to production.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>World Class Support</h2>\n<h3>Minimal Learning Curve for Agency and End Client</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;The Zesty.io team has been incredibly responsive with any support requests we have, and the answers are always very accurate. The support is knowledgeable, available, and has been key in helping us hit our goals for our clients,&rdquo; says Brian.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Slack_RGB.png" data-id="3-904501a-wdnz2" title="Slack_RGB.png" alt="Slack_RGB.png" width="149" height="61" style="float: right;" /></p>\n<p>"With support being included as part of a <a href="https://www.zesty.io/partners/">partnership with Zesty.io</a>, the team was able to get up to speed with the available tooling and launch quickly.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Main mode of support during build: <a href="https://chat.zesty.io">Community Slack Channel</a>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<h2>Sustainable Success</h2>\n<h3>A Look 1 Year After Launch</h3>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" data-id="3-c7a1a5f-7vvmnf" title="Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" width="389" height="254" style="float: left;" />After nearly a year since their initial launch, Singlife has sustained massive traffic spikes to the website seamlessly.

After selecting agency <a href="https://www.rebar.ph/">Rebar Solutions</a> to manage the build from start to finish, the agency helped them find the best platform to meet their needs - Zesty.io. This case study details how Rebar was able to deliver on a brand new site for <a href="https://singlife.com.ph">Singlife Insurance\'s</a> expansion to the Philippines.</p>\n<h2>The Experience Building in Zesty.io</h2>\n<h3>Site Created from Ground Up in Weeks, Not Months</h3>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/singlife-screenshots.png" data-id="3-c7a174d-6zzk7f" title="singlife-screenshots.png" alt="singlife-screenshots.png" width="425" height="273" style="float: right;" />Rebar was tasked with building Singlife&rsquo;s new website marketing their global expansion to serve the Philippines. Designed from the ground up and starting from scratch with a new CMS, the agency was able to deliver a brand new site ahead of schedule.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It took us one month to complete the project, and it was completed as planned and projected," says Brian Nilayan, Head of Business Development at Rebar Solutions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The learning curve was surprisingly easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key positives that we can say for Zesty.io are that the platform is relatively easy to learn, flexible, scalable, and faster to develop on. We were able to meet our deadlines early to allow for extra review and have a seamless launch.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Agency Wins</h2>\n<h3>Zesty.io Empowers Agency with Major Advantages in Client\'s Go To Market</h3>\n<p>In this build, there were significant process improvements for the agency\'s internal workflows. They speak for themselves -&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div><strong>78% faster version control. </strong>Using Zesty.io\'s built in code versioning on every saved code change meant easy reverts to different code versions.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>67% faster development time.</strong> Because backend data handling and different development environment are all handled by Zesty.io, the agency mostly needed to focus on Frontend development.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n<li><strong>69% improvement in page load times. </strong>Server processes are all handled by Zesty.io.</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>42% less agency resources.</strong> With Zesty.io, there is no need for a system admin to handle the project\'s deployment and there are less developers that need to handle the project\'s backend.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>37% reduction in QA Resources. </strong>Due to the site\'s optimized performance and Zesty\'s backend error handlings during development, there was a significant reduction in conflicts when endorsed to the QAs for testing.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>99% faster deployment</strong> - only need to push one button on new or updated page content with real time code changes to production.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>World Class Support</h2>\n<h3>Minimal Learning Curve for Agency and End Client</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;The Zesty.io team has been incredibly responsive with any support requests we have, and the answers are always very accurate. The support is knowledgeable, available, and has been key in helping us hit our goals for our clients,&rdquo; says Brian.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Slack_RGB.png" data-id="3-904501a-wdnz2" title="Slack_RGB.png" alt="Slack_RGB.png" width="149" height="61" style="float: right;" /></p>\n<p>"With support being included as part of a <a href="https://www.zesty.io/partners/">partnership with Zesty.io</a>, the team was able to get up to speed with the available tooling and launch quickly.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Main mode of support during build: <a href="https://chat.zesty.io">Community Slack Channel</a>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<h2>Sustainable Success</h2>\n<h3>A Look 1 Year After Launch</h3>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" data-id="3-c7a1a5f-7vvmnf" title="Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" width="389" height="254" style="float: left;" />After nearly a year since their initial launch, Singlife has sustained massive traffic spikes to the website seamlessly.

That is easier since switching to Zesty.io since even content creators on our team (that can&rsquo;t code) can implement changes on the site and publish new content without assistance of an outside team," says Lemmon.</p>\n<p>Talk about a score.</p>\n<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 55%; position: relative;"><iframe width="100%" height="100%" style="position: absolute; max-width: 100%;" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT0xepBLaRaduNgkne" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="button is-primary is-outlined" href="https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/">View Rocket League\'s Esports Website &gt;</a></p></div>\n</div>\n',

They speak for themselves -&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div><strong>78% faster version control. </strong>Using Zesty.io\'s built in code versioning on every saved code change meant easy reverts to different code versions.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>67% faster development time.</strong> Because backend data handling and different development environment are all handled by Zesty.io, the agency mostly needed to focus on Frontend development.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n<li><strong>69% improvement in page load times. </strong>Server processes are all handled by Zesty.io.</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>42% less agency resources.</strong> With Zesty.io, there is no need for a system admin to handle the project\'s deployment and there are less developers that need to handle the project\'s backend.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>37% reduction in QA Resources. </strong>Due to the site\'s optimized performance and Zesty\'s backend error handlings during development, there was a significant reduction in conflicts when endorsed to the QAs for testing.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>99% faster deployment</strong> - only need to push one button on new or updated page content with real time code changes to production.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>World Class Support</h2>\n<h3>Minimal Learning Curve for Agency and End Client</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;The Zesty.io team has been incredibly responsive with any support requests we have, and the answers are always very accurate. The support is knowledgeable, available, and has been key in helping us hit our goals for our clients,&rdquo; says Brian.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Slack_RGB.png" data-id="3-904501a-wdnz2" title="Slack_RGB.png" alt="Slack_RGB.png" width="149" height="61" style="float: right;" /></p>\n<p>"With support being included as part of a <a href="https://www.zesty.io/partners/">partnership with Zesty.io</a>, the team was able to get up to speed with the available tooling and launch quickly.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Main mode of support during build: <a href="https://chat.zesty.io">Community Slack Channel</a>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<h2>Sustainable Success</h2>\n<h3>A Look 1 Year After Launch</h3>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" data-id="3-c7a1a5f-7vvmnf" title="Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" width="389" height="254" style="float: left;" />After nearly a year since their initial launch, Singlife has sustained massive traffic spikes to the website seamlessly.

Working with an agency, Sony is no stranger to dreaming up large projects and churning them out quickly.</p>\n<p>Most would say that four months to build a website with highly customized design and related content (tying together the artisans to their artwork to their stories to the cameras and accessories they use) is no easy feat.&nbsp;And, in most legacy systems, that would be true. Sony needed a highly secure platform to not only build a website, but build their community.&nbsp;Sony&rsquo;s team uses Zesty.io\'s Two-Factor authentication to stop social engineering attacks and attacks via compromised email accounts.&nbsp; Placing their community in the hands of a highly secure enterprise SaaS platform with 99.99% availability and no patches, plugins, or updates to make meant that the team could focus on what they do best: build.</p>\n<h2>2.25X Faster to Market</h2>\n<p>"We originally allocated 4 months to deploy Sony&rsquo;s &lsquo;Alpha Universe&rsquo; website, designed to drive engagement with both existing and prospective customers of our Alpha camera lineup," says Matthew Parnell, MARCOM Manager of Sony Electronics. "By using Zesty.io as our CMS, we were able to soft launch in 6 weeks and fully launch within 2 months.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So they\'d found a solution that would get them off the ground quickly. Harnessing the power of influencer marketing and highlighting individuals within their community, the growth was exponential.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>164% QoQ Growth Average</h2>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%;" title="Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-3.59.11-PM.png" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-3.59.11-PM.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;With an extremely efficient UI and a host of innovative features, Zesty.io has become the backbone of our customer engagement success, as the site has received over half a million customer visits in its first few months.&rdquo; And it\'s only grown since. In fact, Sony\'s Alpha Universe has expanded globally, harnessing a community of tens of thousands of professional photographers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Zesty.io platform has quickly developed into a global benchmark for Sony&rsquo;s content marketing. We are now working with Zesty.io to deploy this strategy in other key regions throughout the world."&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="be-inspired.jpg" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/be-inspired.jpg" alt="" width="742" height="499" /></p>',

Working with an agency, Sony is no stranger to dreaming up large projects and churning them out quickly.</p>\n<p>Most would say that four months to build a website with highly customized design and related content (tying together the artisans to their artwork to their stories to the cameras and accessories they use) is no easy feat.&nbsp;And, in most legacy systems, that would be true. Sony needed a highly secure platform to not only build a website, but build their community.&nbsp;Sony&rsquo;s team uses Zesty.io\'s Two-Factor authentication to stop social engineering attacks and attacks via compromised email accounts.&nbsp; Placing their community in the hands of a highly secure enterprise SaaS platform with 99.99% availability and no patches, plugins, or updates to make meant that the team could focus on what they do best: build.</p>\n<h2>2.25X Faster to Market</h2>\n<p>"We originally allocated 4 months to deploy Sony&rsquo;s &lsquo;Alpha Universe&rsquo; website, designed to drive engagement with both existing and prospective customers of our Alpha camera lineup," says Matthew Parnell, MARCOM Manager of Sony Electronics. "By using Zesty.io as our CMS, we were able to soft launch in 6 weeks and fully launch within 2 months.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So they\'d found a solution that would get them off the ground quickly. Harnessing the power of influencer marketing and highlighting individuals within their community, the growth was exponential.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>164% QoQ Growth Average</h2>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%;" title="Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-3.59.11-PM.png" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-3.59.11-PM.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;With an extremely efficient UI and a host of innovative features, Zesty.io has become the backbone of our customer engagement success, as the site has received over half a million customer visits in its first few months.&rdquo; And it\'s only grown since. In fact, Sony\'s Alpha Universe has expanded globally, harnessing a community of tens of thousands of professional photographers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Zesty.io platform has quickly developed into a global benchmark for Sony&rsquo;s content marketing. We are now working with Zesty.io to deploy this strategy in other key regions throughout the world."&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="be-inspired.jpg" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/be-inspired.jpg" alt="" width="742" height="499" /></p></div>\n</div>\n',

One that stood out was <a href="https://www.zesty.io/mindshare/customer-stories/sony-uses-zesty-io-to-accelerate-launch-of-alpha-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony\'s Alpha Universe</a>. This is a beautifully designed website created to showcase photographers and their incredible artwork captured with the Sony Alpha Camera line. Psyonix thought they could also showcase their highly active, tight-knit community of Rocket League Esports teams and players.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Leveraging Influencer Marketing to Support Millions of Players and Fans</h2>\n<p>With over 25 million unique players and 1.1 million players a day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on average</a>, the team at Rocket League is fostering and growing a huge community. So they\'d found a solution that would get them off the ground quickly. Harnessing the power of influencer marketing and highlighting individuals within their community, the growth was exponential.</p>\n<p>So, the team set out to create a new space for their players to consume content surrounding the professional side of Rocket League. Managing the feel of the brand on the new website is important, too.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>"Community polls, audio players, and other cool widgets and CMS plugins can be customized with Zesty.io whereas there was not as much flexibility to brand certain elements like that using previous systems. Many of those would have to be outside plugins that didn&rsquo;t really gel with our brand style."</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>- <strong>Kyle Lemmon</strong>, Marketing Manager at Psyonix</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Growing the Professional Side</h2>\n<p><img style="padding: 15px max-width: 100%;" title="kyle-lemmon.jpeg" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/kyle-lemmon.jpeg" alt="" width="157" height="157" align="left" /></p>\n<p>"Our community loves new content and hearing about new updates for the game, and in turn we enjoy finding new ways to improve on the concept of Rocket League while keeping the core gameplay concept intact. Depending on the in-game content, we&rsquo;re able to create and deliver additional promotional content to the community on the site and beyond," says Lemmon. As the community grows, the marketing team continues to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow and support tournaments</a> with payouts of hundreds of thousands of dollars and televised on networks such as Twitch and Turner Broadcasting. The Esports website is the hub for the professional energy surrounding Rocket League.</p>\n<h2>Managing Relational Content in Zesty.io</h2>\n<p>The content throughout the Esports website is highly relational: players are related to teams, and teams to tournaments, tournaments to outcomes, and everything in between. With Zesty.io\'s highly intuitive platform, community managers are able to update content easily on the fly and see those changes updated wherever content appears on the site, ensuring the most up-to-date data in a world where statistics are changing by the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>"We publish blogs on the site almost every week day and landing pages at least one per quarter. That is easier since switching to Zesty.io since even content creators on our team (that can&rsquo;t code) can implement changes on the site and publish new content without assistance of an outside team," says Lemmon.</p>\n<p>Talk about a score.</p>\n<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 55%; position: relative;"><iframe width="100%" height="100%" style="position: absolute; max-width: 100%;" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT0xepBLaRaduNgkne" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="button is-primary is-outlined" href="https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/">View Rocket League\'s Esports Website &gt;</a></p>',

One that stood out was <a href="https://www.zesty.io/mindshare/customer-stories/sony-uses-zesty-io-to-accelerate-launch-of-alpha-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony\'s Alpha Universe</a>. This is a beautifully designed website created to showcase photographers and their incredible artwork captured with the Sony Alpha Camera line. Psyonix thought they could also showcase their highly active, tight-knit community of Rocket League Esports teams and players.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Leveraging Influencer Marketing to Support Millions of Players and Fans</h2>\n<p>With over 25 million unique players and 1.1 million players a day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on average</a>, the team at Rocket League is fostering and growing a huge community. So they\'d found a solution that would get them off the ground quickly. Harnessing the power of influencer marketing and highlighting individuals within their community, the growth was exponential.</p>\n<p>So, the team set out to create a new space for their players to consume content surrounding the professional side of Rocket League. Managing the feel of the brand on the new website is important, too.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>"Community polls, audio players, and other cool widgets and CMS plugins can be customized with Zesty.io whereas there was not as much flexibility to brand certain elements like that using previous systems. Many of those would have to be outside plugins that didn&rsquo;t really gel with our brand style."</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>- <strong>Kyle Lemmon</strong>, Marketing Manager at Psyonix</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Growing the Professional Side</h2>\n<p><img style="padding: 15px max-width: 100%;" title="kyle-lemmon.jpeg" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/kyle-lemmon.jpeg" alt="" width="157" height="157" align="left" /></p>\n<p>"Our community loves new content and hearing about new updates for the game, and in turn we enjoy finding new ways to improve on the concept of Rocket League while keeping the core gameplay concept intact. Depending on the in-game content, we&rsquo;re able to create and deliver additional promotional content to the community on the site and beyond," says Lemmon. As the community grows, the marketing team continues to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow and support tournaments</a> with payouts of hundreds of thousands of dollars and televised on networks such as Twitch and Turner Broadcasting. The Esports website is the hub for the professional energy surrounding Rocket League.</p>\n<h2>Managing Relational Content in Zesty.io</h2>\n<p>The content throughout the Esports website is highly relational: players are related to teams, and teams to tournaments, tournaments to outcomes, and everything in between. With Zesty.io\'s highly intuitive platform, community managers are able to update content easily on the fly and see those changes updated wherever content appears on the site, ensuring the most up-to-date data in a world where statistics are changing by the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>"We publish blogs on the site almost every week day and landing pages at least one per quarter. That is easier since switching to Zesty.io since even content creators on our team (that can&rsquo;t code) can implement changes on the site and publish new content without assistance of an outside team," says Lemmon.</p>\n<p>Talk about a score.</p>\n<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 55%; position: relative;"><iframe width="100%" height="100%" style="position: absolute; max-width: 100%;" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT0xepBLaRaduNgkne" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="button is-primary is-outlined" href="https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/">View Rocket League\'s Esports Website &gt;</a></p></div>\n</div>\n',

Most offices were struggling with their website, weren\'t sure how to edit it, didn\'t know how to update the infrastructure or software, and were generally confused. Seeing this opportunity, Zesty.io and PetDesk partnered to provide websites for PetDesk\'s clientele.</p>\n<p>After partnering with Zesty.io, PetDesk was able to grow its revenue and scale immensely and now manage over one hundred sites without additional personnel or resources. The key to PetDesk\'s continuing success is that its team is empowered by the right technology.</p>\n<h2>New Revenue and Added Client Value</h2>\n<h3>Scalable Multi-site Software that Increased Revenue</h3>\n<p>PetDesk provides an app and reminder system to local veterinarians and pet shops. As with many small businesses, a website can hinder success and served as a barrier to their sales.&nbsp;&ldquo;Zesty.io enabled us to drive immediate revenue while providing tangible value to our customers," says PetDesk CEO Taylor Cavanah. "An integrated PetDesk and Zesty.io solution allowed us to offer a complete retention and acquisition solution to our customers that was once cost prohibitive."</p>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%;" title="Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-5.03.48-PM.png" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-5.03.48-PM.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>\n<p>Even better, Zesty.io\'s SaaS solution could be implemented in seconds, not days, weeks, or even months. "Practically overnight we could make our customers happier, while growing revenue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Zesty.io integration is now a key differentiator in our sales pitch," says Cavanah.</p>\n<h2>Scalable Multi-site Management</h2>\n<p>As the model proved successful, there were some hesitations of growing costs to accommodate the growing demand. &ldquo;The platform allowed us to double our website builds and services using our existing staff. After setting up, our existing sales team starting selling the websites as an add-on immediately while our accounts team fulfilled the service. Every account manager became proficient in the platform in a few days time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Tailored to Customers</h2>\n<h3>Template design to match targeted industries</h3>\n<p>Part of why PetDesk\'s implementation was so speedy and continues to be so scalable is the templated nature of PetDesk sites, "When we started, we worked with Zesty.io&rsquo;s team to create unique website designs that matched our customer demographic. This gives our sales team options to present our customers." And, as PetDesk continues to scale, all they need is a front-end developer to continue building new templates or accommodate custom requests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="petdesk-zestyio.jpg" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/petdesk-zestyio.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="244" /></p>',

Most offices were struggling with their website, weren\'t sure how to edit it, didn\'t know how to update the infrastructure or software, and were generally confused. Seeing this opportunity, Zesty.io and PetDesk partnered to provide websites for PetDesk\'s clientele.</p>\n<p>After partnering with Zesty.io, PetDesk was able to grow its revenue and scale immensely and now manage over one hundred sites without additional personnel or resources. The key to PetDesk\'s continuing success is that its team is empowered by the right technology.</p>\n<h2>New Revenue and Added Client Value</h2>\n<h3>Scalable Multi-site Software that Increased Revenue</h3>\n<p>PetDesk provides an app and reminder system to local veterinarians and pet shops. As with many small businesses, a website can hinder success and served as a barrier to their sales.&nbsp;&ldquo;Zesty.io enabled us to drive immediate revenue while providing tangible value to our customers," says PetDesk CEO Taylor Cavanah. "An integrated PetDesk and Zesty.io solution allowed us to offer a complete retention and acquisition solution to our customers that was once cost prohibitive."</p>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%;" title="Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-5.03.48-PM.png" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2018-10-18-at-5.03.48-PM.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>\n<p>Even better, Zesty.io\'s SaaS solution could be implemented in seconds, not days, weeks, or even months. "Practically overnight we could make our customers happier, while growing revenue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Zesty.io integration is now a key differentiator in our sales pitch," says Cavanah.</p>\n<h2>Scalable Multi-site Management</h2>\n<p>As the model proved successful, there were some hesitations of growing costs to accommodate the growing demand. &ldquo;The platform allowed us to double our website builds and services using our existing staff. After setting up, our existing sales team starting selling the websites as an add-on immediately while our accounts team fulfilled the service. Every account manager became proficient in the platform in a few days time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Tailored to Customers</h2>\n<h3>Template design to match targeted industries</h3>\n<p>Part of why PetDesk\'s implementation was so speedy and continues to be so scalable is the templated nature of PetDesk sites, "When we started, we worked with Zesty.io&rsquo;s team to create unique website designs that matched our customer demographic. This gives our sales team options to present our customers." And, as PetDesk continues to scale, all they need is a front-end developer to continue building new templates or accommodate custom requests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="petdesk-zestyio.jpg" src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/petdesk-zestyio.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="244" /></p></div>\n</div>\n',

               '<p>Digital life insurer Singlife needed a lightweight, reliable, enterprise-scalable platform to be the foundation of their global expansion. After selecting agency <a href="https://www.rebar.ph/">Rebar Solutions</a> to manage the build from start to finish, the agency helped them find the best platform to meet their needs - Zesty.io. This case study details how Rebar was able to deliver on a brand new site for <a href="https://singlife.com.ph">Singlife Insurance\'s</a> expansion to the Philippines.</p>\n<h2>The Experience Building in Zesty.io</h2>\n<h3>Site Created from Ground Up in Weeks, Not Months</h3>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/singlife-screenshots.png" data-id="3-c7a174d-6zzk7f" title="singlife-screenshots.png" alt="singlife-screenshots.png" width="425" height="273" style="float: right;" />Rebar was tasked with building Singlife&rsquo;s new website marketing their global expansion to serve the Philippines. Designed from the ground up and starting from scratch with a new CMS, the agency was able to deliver a brand new site ahead of schedule.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It took us one month to complete the project, and it was completed as planned and projected," says Brian Nilayan, Head of Business Development at Rebar Solutions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The learning curve was surprisingly easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key positives that we can say for Zesty.io are that the platform is relatively easy to learn, flexible, scalable, and faster to develop on. We were able to meet our deadlines early to allow for extra review and have a seamless launch.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Agency Wins</h2>\n<h3>Zesty.io Empowers Agency with Major Advantages in Client\'s Go To Market</h3>\n<p>In this build, there were significant process improvements for the agency\'s internal workflows. They speak for themselves -&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div><strong>78% faster version control. </strong>Using Zesty.io\'s built in code versioning on every saved code change meant easy reverts to different code versions.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>67% faster development time.</strong> Because backend data handling and different development environment are all handled by Zesty.io, the agency mostly needed to focus on Frontend development.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n<li><strong>69% improvement in page load times. </strong>Server processes are all handled by Zesty.io.</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>42% less agency resources.</strong> With Zesty.io, there is no need for a system admin to handle the project\'s deployment and there are less developers that need to handle the project\'s backend.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>37% reduction in QA Resources. </strong>Due to the site\'s optimized performance and Zesty\'s backend error handlings during development, there was a significant reduction in conflicts when endorsed to the QAs for testing.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>99% faster deployment</strong> - only need to push one button on new or updated page content with real time code changes to production.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>World Class Support</h2>\n<h3>Minimal Learning Curve for Agency and End Client</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;The Zesty.io team has been incredibly responsive with any support requests we have, and the answers are always very accurate. The support is knowledgeable, available, and has been key in helping us hit our goals for our clients,&rdquo; says Brian.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Slack_RGB.png" data-id="3-904501a-wdnz2" title="Slack_RGB.png" alt="Slack_RGB.png" width="149" height="61" style="float: right;" /></p>\n<p>"With support being included as part of a <a href="https://www.zesty.io/partners/">partnership with Zesty.io</a>, the team was able to get up to speed with the available tooling and launch quickly.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Main mode of support during build: <a href="https://chat.zesty.io">Community Slack Channel</a>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<h2>Sustainable Success</h2>\n<h3>A Look 1 Year After Launch</h3>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" data-id="3-c7a1a5f-7vvmnf" title="Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" width="389" height="254" style="float: left;" />After nearly a year since their initial launch, Singlife has sustained massive traffic spikes to the website seamlessly.

After selecting agency <a href="https://www.rebar.ph/">Rebar Solutions</a> to manage the build from start to finish, the agency helped them find the best platform to meet their needs - Zesty.io. This case study details how Rebar was able to deliver on a brand new site for <a href="https://singlife.com.ph">Singlife Insurance\'s</a> expansion to the Philippines.</p>\n<h2>The Experience Building in Zesty.io</h2>\n<h3>Site Created from Ground Up in Weeks, Not Months</h3>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/singlife-screenshots.png" data-id="3-c7a174d-6zzk7f" title="singlife-screenshots.png" alt="singlife-screenshots.png" width="425" height="273" style="float: right;" />Rebar was tasked with building Singlife&rsquo;s new website marketing their global expansion to serve the Philippines. Designed from the ground up and starting from scratch with a new CMS, the agency was able to deliver a brand new site ahead of schedule.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It took us one month to complete the project, and it was completed as planned and projected," says Brian Nilayan, Head of Business Development at Rebar Solutions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The learning curve was surprisingly easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key positives that we can say for Zesty.io are that the platform is relatively easy to learn, flexible, scalable, and faster to develop on. We were able to meet our deadlines early to allow for extra review and have a seamless launch.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Agency Wins</h2>\n<h3>Zesty.io Empowers Agency with Major Advantages in Client\'s Go To Market</h3>\n<p>In this build, there were significant process improvements for the agency\'s internal workflows. They speak for themselves -&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div><strong>78% faster version control. </strong>Using Zesty.io\'s built in code versioning on every saved code change meant easy reverts to different code versions.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>67% faster development time.</strong> Because backend data handling and different development environment are all handled by Zesty.io, the agency mostly needed to focus on Frontend development.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n<li><strong>69% improvement in page load times. </strong>Server processes are all handled by Zesty.io.</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>42% less agency resources.</strong> With Zesty.io, there is no need for a system admin to handle the project\'s deployment and there are less developers that need to handle the project\'s backend.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>37% reduction in QA Resources. </strong>Due to the site\'s optimized performance and Zesty\'s backend error handlings during development, there was a significant reduction in conflicts when endorsed to the QAs for testing.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>99% faster deployment</strong> - only need to push one button on new or updated page content with real time code changes to production.&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>World Class Support</h2>\n<h3>Minimal Learning Curve for Agency and End Client</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;The Zesty.io team has been incredibly responsive with any support requests we have, and the answers are always very accurate. The support is knowledgeable, available, and has been key in helping us hit our goals for our clients,&rdquo; says Brian.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Slack_RGB.png" data-id="3-904501a-wdnz2" title="Slack_RGB.png" alt="Slack_RGB.png" width="149" height="61" style="float: right;" /></p>\n<p>"With support being included as part of a <a href="https://www.zesty.io/partners/">partnership with Zesty.io</a>, the team was able to get up to speed with the available tooling and launch quickly.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Main mode of support during build: <a href="https://chat.zesty.io">Community Slack Channel</a>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<h2>Sustainable Success</h2>\n<h3>A Look 1 Year After Launch</h3>\n<p><img src="https://kfg6bckb.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" data-id="3-c7a1a5f-7vvmnf" title="Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-11.52.11-AM.png" width="389" height="254" style="float: left;" />After nearly a year since their initial launch, Singlife has sustained massive traffic spikes to the website seamlessly.
